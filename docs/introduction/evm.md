## What is the EVM?

EVM is short for Ethereum Virtual Machine. Let’s start with Virtual Machines in simple words. The purpose of a virtual machine is to virtualize the version of a host computer or server (like client APIs) and deploy that version on multiple (end-user) systems across the world with the help of software programs and automation. In Web 1.0 and Web 2.0, the software programs are typically installed and maintained by developers in centralized institutions for proprietary use.

Now let’s bring the Ethereum network into the mix. With EVM in Web 3.0, open-source blockchain is used to handle the virtualization of servers across multiple systems with the help of network protocols. The technology is primarily operated and maintained by unrelated nodes on the network resulting in high decentralization. Moreover, EVM was further developed to perform and execute any logical step of a computational function through its ‘smart contract’ with a level of automation that was never seen before.

We now have a state machine that virtualizes servers and interfaces of thousands of applications across multiple systems with an unbelievable level of automation. So, in effect, what you see with Ethereum is not just a decentralized ledger holding data on accounts and balances but also its capability to store an entire state data of a ton of scalable applications and other web 3.0 commercial services that sits on top of it.

## Shardeum is EVM Compatible

If you are one of those Ethereum or Ethereum-based developers, please note that Shardeum is EVM compatible. You don't need to change your application codes to launch various dApps you are building on Shardeum. Any smart contract written to run in EVM can be easily ported to the Shardeum network. You just need to deploy a smart contract written in Solidity or Vyper on Shardeum with a bonus that you will never have to worry about rising gas fees again.
